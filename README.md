# Greekonomics Survey - Python Implementation

This repository contains a Python adaptation of the insightful economic survey originally conducted by **Greekonomics** in [R](https://github.com/AMantes/Greekonomics/tree/main). The project aims to recreate and potentially extend the analysis while paying full homage to the original creator's important work.

## 🎯 Original Work & Tribute

### Greekonomics' Contribution
Massive respect and gratitude to **[Greekonomics](https://www.youtube.com/@Greekonomics)** for his exceptional economic analysis not only in this survey, but with every uploaded video. Through his information we finally have a clear view from what is going on and how the system works.

🔗 **Original Resources**:
- [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Greekonomics)
- [GitHub Repository (R implementation)](https://github.com/AMantes/Greekonomics/tree/main)

## 🐍 Python Implementation Goals

This adaptation seeks to:
1. Replicate the original survey methodology using Python's data science stack
2. Maintain full analytical transparency like Greekonomics' work
3. Explore potential extensions using:
   - Additional Eurostat datasets
   - Advanced visualization techniques
   - Time-series analysis enhancements
4. Create an alternative implementation for the Python ecosystem

### Potential Extensions (Building on Thesis Experience)
Leveraging my experience working with Eurostat data during my thesis, possible enhancements include:
- Integration with Eurostat's API (`pandas-datareader`)
- Multi-country comparative analysis
- Dynamic dashboard creation (Streamlit)
- Structural economic relationship modeling
- Sensitivity analysis of key economic parameters

## ⚙️ Technical Stack
A[Eurostat API] --> B(Pandas/NumPy)
B --> C(Statsmodels/Scikit-learn)
C --> D(Matplotlib/Seaborn)
D --> E(Interactive Visualizations)
